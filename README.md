Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

Create and Save Artists

Create and Save Albums

List All Artists/Albums

List all the albums they have by an artist

Show the artist any album belongs to

Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

Edit Artists/Albums
Delete Artists/Albums
Find Artists/Albums by their ID
Remember to regularly git commit!
